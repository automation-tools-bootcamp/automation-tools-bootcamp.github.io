<a name="introduction-to-inspec" class="anchor" href="#introduction-to-inspec"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Introduction to InSpec</h3>

<p><img src="./images/inspec.png" /><br />
  <br />
<a href="https://www.inspec.io/" target="_new">InSpec</a> is an Auditing and Testing Framework from <a href="https://chef.io" target="_new">Chef</a>.<br />
<br />
You are probably familiar with Chef providing tools to <a href="./chef.html">configure your machines</a>.  InSpec is a new tool extending the scope where Chef can watch over your machines for their entire lifecycle.  The use of InSpec does not require a Chef Server or the Chef Client.  InSpec is focused on proving your systems are in an expected state through compliance as code.<br />
<br />
This can mean a user account exists on the machine, certain rules for password requirements are being met, services are running as expected and more.</p>

<h3><a name="vs-serverspec" class="anchor" href="#vs-serverspec"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Going beyond ServerSpec</h3>
<p>
InSpec shares its roots with another tool, <a href="http://serverspec.org/" target="_new">ServerSpec</a>, which is also a Ruby <a href="http://rspec.info" target="_new">RSpec</a> based testing framework.  There are two key differentiators from ServerSpec that I appreciate the most.<br />
<br />
First up - InSpec has connection protocols built-in which allow it to talk directly to remote systems over SSH, WinRM or to Docker containers. These transports allows you to have a central machine watching over your flock of machines.  If you are really interested in this type of setup, Chef has a commercial offering called the <a href="https://www.chef.io/compliance/" target="_new">Compliance Server</a>.  It is a powerful ally to running your InSpec tests, but is not required to run your InSpec tests.  You can achieve the same core functionality by having a Jenkins job execute InSpec against various remote machines, but you would be on your own to generate the resulting alerts and reports.<br />
<br />
Secondly, InSpec allows you to give each control group you create an <code>impact</code> score to weigh the importance of the rules you are writing.  Having <code>telnet</code> enabled can be ranked as a show stopper.  But unexpected contents in your application's configuration file could only raise a warning.  Using the <code>impact</code> score to improve your signal to noise ratio of the alerts being raised can be an invaluable gain.
</p>

<h3><a name="always-be-testing" class="anchor" href="#always-be-testing"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Always be testing</h3>
<p>
You don't want your machines to be in compliance just at the moment they are turned on and initially configured. You <em>*need*</em> your machines to always be compliant.  Depending on your business needs this can mean validation once a day, once a week or once every 15 minutes.  The more frequently you validate your machines, the quicker you can identify what (and hopefully correspondingly who) changed the system.  I recommend scanning them as frequently as is possible and useful to you.

<h3><a name="standard-tests" class="anchor" href="#standard-tests"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Standard Tests</h3>
<p>
  The work you do probably is goverened by some standard compliance rules like following <a href="https://www.cisecurity.org/" target="_new">Center for Internet Security (CIS)</a> benchmark or <a href="https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/" target="_new">Payment Card Industry (PCI)</a> compliance rules.  These are standard tests and users are posting shared compliance profiles to the <a href="https://supermarket.chef.io/tools?type=compliance_profile" target="_new">Chef Supermarket</a>.  Look for this list to grow with time.
</p>

<h3><a name="summary" class="anchor" href="#summary"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Summary</h3>
<p>
  Combining InSpec in to your development workflow and production monitoring will give you the benefit of ensuring your machines are in a consistent state of being.  More importantly - any future changes to your machines will maintain consistent state or raise an alert.  A quick fingered admin who likes to get directly on machines and update configurations can be kept in check by InSpec with quick alerts after their changes have brought a machine out of compliance.

<h2><a name="workout" class="anchor" href="#workout"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Workout</h2>

<p>We are going to complete the following actions</p>
<ol>
  <li>InSpec is installed on our trusty VM.  It acutally comes bundled in the Chef DK, which is how it was installed on our class VM.</li>
  <li>We're going to execute the example <a href="https://github.com/dev-sec/tests-os-hardening#standalone-usage" target="_new">OS Hardening profile</a> against our class VM.</li>
  <li>We already have InSpec OS hardening profile in the <code>inspec</code> directory, so let's go there on the VM <code>cd /vagrant/inspec</code>.</li>
  <li><code>inspec exec tests-os-hardening</code></li>
  <li>The results will tell us how well I did making a hardened OS for the class VM.  ***Spoiler Alert*** I didn't make any efforts to do this.</li>
  <li>But, we can use same profile against one of our Docker containers from the <a href="./artifactory.html#workout">Artifactory workout</a>.  An example of using InSpec with the <code>docker://</code> transport is in the <a href="https://github.com/chef/inspec#detect" target="_new">InSpec README</a>.</li>
  <li>First, let's make sure we can connect to the container. We know the name of our container is <code>artifactory</code> and since we are using Docker we'll <code>sudo</code> to make the command <code>sudo inspec detect -t docker://artifactory</code> and what do we learn about it?</li>
  <li>Now we can do our scan with a <code>sudo inspec exec tests-os-hardening -t docker://artifactory</code>.</li>
  <li>The results say? Who released the more hardened OS image?</li>
</ol>
